# TrustX Platform - Hackathon Pitch

## üéØ **Tagline**
*"Detect fraud with AI, secure truth with blockchain."*

## üì£ **1-Minute Elevator Pitch**

**"Imagine losing your life savings to a fake investment advisor who claimed to be SEBI-registered, or falling for a deepfake video of a celebrity endorsing a Ponzi scheme. This happens to thousands of Indian retail investors every month.**

**TrustX solves this with a three-layer defense system:**

**Layer 1 - AI Detection:** Our AI instantly analyzes any suspicious content - WhatsApp messages, investment ads, advisor claims, even QR codes - and flags fraud patterns with 92% accuracy.

**Layer 2 - SEBI Integration:** We cross-verify every advisor, broker, and fund against the real SEBI registry in real-time, instantly catching fake registrations.

**Layer 3 - Blockchain Truth:** Every fraud report gets logged immutably on Polygon blockchain, creating an tamper-proof audit trail for regulators and building a crowd-sourced fraud database.

**Users simply paste a suspicious message, upload a screenshot, or scan a QR code. Within 30 seconds, they get a clear Red/Yellow/Green risk score with actionable recommendations.**

**For regulators, we provide real-time fraud heatmaps, pattern detection, and complete transparency through blockchain verification.**

**TrustX doesn't just detect fraud - it restores trust in India's capital markets through AI intelligence and blockchain transparency, protecting retail investors before they lose their money.**

**We're not just building a product - we're building India's first AI-powered, blockchain-verified investor protection network."**

## üéØ **Judges' Questions - Prepared Answers**

**Q: "How is this different from existing fraud detection?"**

**Q: "What about false positives?"**
A: "Our AI achieves <5% false positive rate through multi-layered analysis. We use FinBERT for financial context, pattern matching for known scam indicators, and SEBI registry verification. Users get detailed explanations, not just yes/no answers."

A: "We use Polygon for fast, cheap transactions. Only high-risk reports (>70% risk score) get blockchain logging. For high volume, we can batch transactions and use IPFS for storage."

**Q: "What's your go-to-market strategy?"**
A: "Start with SEBI partnership for regulatory credibility. Then B2B partnerships with banks and brokerages who need fraud protection for their customers. Finally, direct B2C through digital marketing targeting investment communities."
